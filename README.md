# Deep-Learning-Evaluation-of-IDS-Datasets
Deep Model Intrusion Detection Evaluation of NSL KDD and CIC IDS 2018 datasets.

# Usage
- install jupyter-notebook.
```bash
pip install jupyter-notebook
```
- Download the .ipynb files via `git clone` or download `zip`.
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/WhiteHatCyberus/Deep-Learning-Evaluation-of-IDS-Datasets.git
```
- Now run the `jupyter-notebook` command in the directory where the extracted zip file is found.
- All componenets of the jupyter-notebooks are all found in the folder.

## Credits
